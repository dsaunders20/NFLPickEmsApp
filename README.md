First attempt at soloing a webapp. 

Using nodejs & express I am creating a webapp where users can create an account and predict the winners of every NFL game while competing with their friends to see who does the best!

The app uses mongoDB and password encryption to safely store data.

Production version deployed using heroku. 

.. pardon my dust
